                                With the exponential advancements in technologies, the flourishing cloud-based computing is taking our way of working to a new level of flexibility. Business models are a lot more practical and support prompt responses with the flexibility of working remotely or in different time zones.
                                 The software system is more active even with limited computing availability, requires only a good internet connection with high bandwidth. 
                                For the same, internet infrastructure and high-speed bandwidth support are now readily available in most of the developed cities and even in places for vacations. 
                                
                            </p>

                                        The constantly changing web technologies, AI, IoT, OS, and Kernel-based support for fast computing chipsets are all helping to support Industry 4.0 and parallelly providing the scaffolding for software 4.0 growth and development. 
                                        Having said that, Covid-19 worked as the catalyst to make industries, companies, Institutes, and businesses strictly adopt this infrastructure of new web-based remote working.
                                         This system has enabled the world to work in collaboration whether as a conglomerate or as one brain with billions of sub brains and trillions and trillions of neurons to process the information in coordination.

                                        Within 2 years software4.0 is now accessible by half the population of earth and used in 91% of firms, especially in fintech and Banking systems. 
                                        With its rapid growth and smart infrastructure having a concrete foundation on Machine learning-based software implementation, 
                                        the overall system is highly scalable and robust based on Asymmetric clustering in the intranet for firms with high security and Internet for most of the firms with high-end resource sharing.

                                            It is difficult to predict the future, but the upcoming support for quantum computing can increase the software automation by 100x with the most simple algorithms to work for the most complex calculations having the ocean of redundant data within minutes. 
                                            Which can surely disrupt the industries within months if they are not going to adapt to this change in computing resources and support the ever-changing and growing developments.
