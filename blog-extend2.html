                            <p class="tm-mb-40">Using Python Selenium library to automate the Instagram activity</p>
                            <p>
                                This is a simple guide to create an Instagram bot to automate the processes like logging
                                in, following, and unfollowing people on Instagram without spamming Instagram.
                                This bot is made in python with a selenium library. The bot will save time by automating
                                the processes and running after a random period of time.
                                You will discover that selenium is a very powerful library and you do not need much
                                programming experience in python to make this bot.
                            </p>

                                        <p>
                                            For this project, I will be using the selenium library. The other option is
                                            to use the Instagram API.
                                            However, its usage is strictly monitored to align with Instagram’s user
                                            guidelines.
                                            Selenium is a very powerful library that gives freedom from any API’s.
                                            The library was originally developed for web application testing.
                                            However, with the combination of python and selenium, one can automate the
                                            browser processes or web scraping with minimal coding knowledge.

                                    <p>
                                        For the selenium library to access your browser, a web driver is necessary.
                                        I used geckodriver for my Firefox browser. Nevertheless, one can easily change
                                        to chrome by download Chromedriver.
                                        You can download geckodriver from here or Chrome Driver from here. Also, for
                                        Chrome, you will need to change webdriver.
                                        Firefox to webdriver.Chrome, and specify the path of the executable file of the
                                        web driver.
                                    </p>

                                        The first thing we would like to do is log in to your Instagram account.
                                        I am using XPath of the elements to find the username and password field in the
                                        browser.
                                        The .click() functionality of the Selenium is used to click the element. On the
                                        login page, we use it to click the submit button.
                                        After logging in, you would be asked for turning ON the Instagram notification.
                                        The bot can easily get rid of it by clicking the “Not Now” button.

                                        I was wondering what will be the optimal algorithm to increase the followers on
                                        Instagram without spamming or getting blocked.
                                        Initially, I came up with the idea of following the people from the Instagram’s
                                        suggestion list.
                                        Nevertheless, after a few runs, Instagram started suggesting verified accounts.
                                        These are the accounts with millions of followers and the odds are very low that
                                        these accounts will follow you back. With this strategy, our bot will be used to
                                        increase the following of the verified accounts, which is futile.
                                        I had to devise another strategy to follow the people who have the maximum
                                        probability of following us back.
                                        These people are the people who share the same interest as your Instagram
                                        account.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <h2 class="pt-2 tm-color-primary tm-post-title">Following</h2>
                                <div class="tm-comment">
                                    <p>
                                        In this example, I posted supercars pictures on my account. Therefore, I made a
                                        python list of Instagram's famous supercars accounts.
                                        From the list of these accounts, the bot randomly selects a one and searches for
                                        it on Instagram.
                                        From the followers list of these accounts, the bot follows some of the people.
                                        These people have the highest odds to follow our account back. You can set the
                                        number of people to follow in one browsing session.
                                        To avoid spamming, do not follow many people at one time.
                                        After following people, the bot will close the browser and sleep for a random
                                        number of seconds given by the user input.
                                    </p>

                                        I use XPath to find the element. However, the XPath might change when the

                                        It can easily found by using the inspect element → Copy XPath in the browser.

                                        Following too many people will increase your following list of the account.
                                        Therefore, to get rid of excessive following people. An unfollow function is
                                        made which can unfollow people.
                                        You can set a limit on the maximum number of following for your account.
                                        The bot will log in back to the account and check the following list of your
                                        account.
                                        If the following people are less then the user-specified limit, it will do
                                        nothing and close the browser, else it will start unfollowing people till the
                                        limit condition is satisfied and then close the browser.
                                    </p>

                                        Nonetheless, if you unfollow the recently followed people, then they might not
                                        get enough time to follow you back.
                                        Hence, the bot scrolls all the way down to the bottom of the following list of
